_Estas instrucciones están [disponibles en español](./CONTEXT-trackflow.es.md)._

> This document describes your company and the specific situation you're building this milestone for. Read it completely before writing any code. Everything you build must reflect this context.

## Your company

**TrackFlow** is a last-mile delivery and warehouse management company founded in 2009 in Los Angeles, United States. It operates in two markets—United States (Los Angeles) and Spain (Zaragoza)—and offers three services: warehouse management for e-commerce brands, last-mile delivery (the final leg from warehouse to end customer), and reverse logistics (returns and product reconditioning). It has approximately 130 employees and generates around 9 million euros in annual revenue. Its clients are mid-sized fashion, electronics, and cosmetics brands that sell online.

## Your department and the problem you must solve

You work in the **TrackFlow Tech** unit, reporting directly to CTO Andrés Kim. TrackFlow's current corporate website was built years ago by an external agency and is completely outdated. It doesn't reflect that the company operates in two countries, doesn't clearly explain the services, and there's no way for interested companies to request information in a structured manner. Miguel Torres (Commercial Director) needs a professional website that presents TrackFlow's services and captures leads from potential companies that want to outsource their logistics.

## Your stakeholder

**Miguel Torres**, Commercial Director

> Hi,
>
> We need a new website that presents TrackFlow as what we are: a serious logistics operator with presence in the United States and Spain. It must explain our three main services: warehouse management, last mile, and reverse logistics. I also need a page with a form so interested companies can request information. We currently get very vague inquiries by email and waste a lot of time qualifying whether they're real clients or not. I want to capture: company data, type of product they handle, estimated monthly shipping volume, countries where they operate, and which services interest them. The site must be responsive, accessible, and SEO optimized. Use Tailwind and make sure the form has complete validation.

## Specific restriction

The form is designed for **e-commerce companies looking to outsource their logistics**, not for end consumers who want to track a package or make a return. If you detect that the selected volume is "0-100 shipments/month" AND the "Product type" field is relevant, include a warning message: "For volumes under 100 monthly shipments, our services might not be the most efficient solution. Are you sure you want to continue?"
